OpenRL
======

A rogue-like library written in HaXe* designed to logically abstract various back-ends.

*HaXe is an ECMAScript style language with powerful meta-features.

So what is it?
==============

Right now it's not much more than a Console Emulator (A logical abstraction of the Curses interface used to represent an ascii graphical environment) with an OpenFL* back-end implemented.

I started the project as a framework for prototyping various game-play ideas primarily associated with procedural content generation and AI. I plan on implementing a Window Manager scheme on top of the graphical console and will probably build a server-client architecture for managing game logic.

*OpenFL is an abstraction of the flash API designed to target mobile, web, and native platforms. It's very intuitive and ideal for rapid development.
